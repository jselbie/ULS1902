From a given table with N members, find the longest sub-sequence whose sum does not exceed S. A sub-sequence is a set of consecutive numbers in a base table.

Restrictions:

N≤500,000

S≤1,000,000,000

−1,000,000≤Ai≤1,000,000 (Value of Sequence Members)

Input
In the first line of the test, the numbers N and S are separated by a space. The next line contains N numbers representing the members of the sequence.

Output
On one line, print the length of the longest sub-sequence whose sum does not exceed S and its starting number. If there are multiple answers, print the appropriate number first. (Numbered starting from Table 1)

Note: The longest sub-sequence whose sum does not exceed 666 is a sequence of 10 lengths starting from the 2nd and 3rd members of the table, but the answer is 10 2 because the number at the beginning is printed.
